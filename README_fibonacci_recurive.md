#Recursive Fibonacci

In mathematics, the Fibonacci sequence is a sequence in which each number is the sum of the two numbers that precede it. This algorithm prompts the user for how many terms of the sequence they would like to see, then recursively finds and then prints each term of the sequence

Step 1: Create a for loop from 0 to n, printing out the result from the Fibonacci function each iteration

Step 2: If you reach the base case n <= 1, return n

Step 3: If you are not at the base case, recursively call the fibonacci function for n - 1, and n - 2, added together
